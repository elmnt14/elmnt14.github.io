		  		<!--العنصر ١٤ (/ʕun.sˤur /, romanized: al-ʿUnsur ʾarbaʿata ʿašar) is 
		  		an Arabic language channel about computering. -->
		  		العنصر <span class="elmnt-green">14</span> (Al-Unsur Arbatash, Element <span class="elmnt-green">14</span>) is an Arabic language channel about computing.
		  		</p>

		  		<p class="en">
		  		The idea for this channel stems from our desire to start an initiative that 
		  		explains the computer technology we use in a simplified manner 
		  		accessible to a wide audience and in Arabic. The channel is also a contribution to 
		  		enriching Arabic scientific content on the Web, focusing on the field of information 
		  		technology. Through videos published biweekly, the channel offers scientific information
		  		about computer technologies and concepts with which we interact on a daily basis in a fun
		  		and engaging manner.

		  		<p class="en">
		  		The name العنصر <span class="elmnt-green">14</span> (Al-Unsur Arbatash, Element <span class="elmnt-green">14</span>) is a reference to the semiconductor element <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon">silicon</a> (atomic number 14). Silicon is a crucial element in the manufacturing of electronics
		  		such as integrated circuits and transistors, which, in turn, were crucial in bringing on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age">computer age</a>. Because of its importance to the computer
		  		age, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_technology_centers#Places_with_%22Silicon%22_names">many places bear its name</a>, including this channel.
